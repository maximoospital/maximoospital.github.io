## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://github.com/maximoospital/Effect-House-Branded-Randomizer-Filter/raw/main/images/demo.gif)

A simple template for a branded randomizer filter made in TikTok's Effect House. Includes custom background, logos, multiple carrousel choices and a secondary image fade-in.

Haven't really seen many filter templates on github so i decided to upload a few of mine, starting with this one.

## Built With



* [Effect House](https://effecthouse.tiktok.com/)

## Getting Started

To get this template up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Prerequisites

Install Effect House v3.9.2.55 a.k.a the latest one as of 27/3/2024.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/maximoospital/Effect-House-Branded-Randomizer-Filter.git
```

2. Not much really, just open the .ehproj file and do whatever you like dude.

## Usage

The branded aspect is really useful for making marketing filters, and the randomizer is really easy to customize, plus it features a second layer that shows images based on the randomizers result.
