## About The Project

![Screen Shot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maximoospital/Effect-House-Branded-Masked-Waves-Filter/main/images/demo.gif)

A simple template for a branded masked waves filter made in TikTok's Effect House. Includes overlay logos, a mask for the waves effect, and an animated overlay featuring a footer and a logo, both with transitions.

Haven't really seen many filter templates on github so i decided to upload a few of mine, starting with this one.

## Built With



* [Effect House](https://effecthouse.tiktok.com/)

## Getting Started

To get this template up and running follow these simple example steps.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
